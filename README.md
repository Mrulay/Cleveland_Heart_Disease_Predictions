# Cleveland_Heart_Disease_Predictions
This Repository contains analysis and predictions based on a dataset containing information about severity of heart diseases. 

The Contents of this dataset are:
> 1. age
> 2. sex
> 3. chest pain type (4 values)
> 4. resting blood pressure
> 5. serum cholestoral in mg/dl
> 6. fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
> 7. resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
> 8. maximum heart rate achieved
> 9. exercise induced angina
> 10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
> 11. the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
> 12. number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
> 13. thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect

The above data was taken from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease

I have ran some analysis to find out the culprit of severity of the heart diseases and did find some interesting insights.
All the visualizations and predicted models are in the jupyter notebook.
